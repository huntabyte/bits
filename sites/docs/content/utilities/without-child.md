description: A type helper to exclude the child snippet prop from a component.

The `WithoutChild` type helper is used to exclude the `child` snippet prop from a component. This is useful when you're building custom component wrappers that populate the `children` prop of a component and don't provide a way to pass a custom `child` snippet.

To learn more about the `child` snippet prop, check out the [delegation](/docs/delegation) documentation.
