## Overview

The PIN Input component provides a customizable solution for One-Time Password (OTP), Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) input fields. Due to the lack of a native HTML element for these purposes, developers often resort to either basic input fields or custom implementations. This component offers a robust, accessible, and flexible alternative.

This component is derived from and would not have been possible without the work done by [Guilherme Rodz](https://x.com/guilhermerodz) with [Input OTP](https://github.com/guilhermerodz/input-otp).

## Key Features

-   **Invisible Input Technique**: Utilizes an invisible input element for seamless integration with form submissions and browser autofill functionality.
-   **Customizable Appearance**: Allows for custom designs while maintaining core functionality.
-   **Accessibility**: Ensures keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
-   **Flexible Configuration**: Supports various PIN lengths and input types (numeric, alphanumeric).

## Architecture

1. **Root Container**: A relatively positioned root element that encapsulates the entire component.
2. **Invisible Input**: A hidden input field that manages the actual value and interacts with the browser's built-in features.
3. **Visual Cells**: Customizable elements representing each character of the PIN, rendered as siblings to the invisible input.

This structure allows for a seamless user experience while providing developers with full control over the visual representation.

## Structure

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { PinInput } from "bits-ui";
</script>

<PinInput.Root maxlength={6}>
	{#snippet children({ cells })}
		{#each cells as cell}
			<PinInput.Cell {cell} />
		{/each}
	{/snippet}
</PinInput.Root>
```

## Paste Handling

The `onPaste` prop allows you to sanitize pasted text. This can be useful for cleaning up pasted text, like removing hyphens or other characters that should not make it into the input. This function should return the sanitized text.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { PinInput } from "bits-ui";
</script>

<PinInput.Root onPaste={(text) => text.replace(/-/g, "")}>
	<!-- ... -->
</PinInput.Root>
```

<APISection {schemas} />
